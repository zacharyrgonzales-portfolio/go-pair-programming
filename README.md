# Purpose:

## Dashboard of Docker Images:
Display a list of available Docker images on the system.

## Running Docker Containers:
Show a list of currently running Docker containers, including essential details like container ID, name, status, etc.

## History of Docker Objects:
Provide a history or log of Docker objects, possibly including created, deleted, or modified containers, images, etc.

# Commands:

- **dashboard**: This will be the main command that users will run to see the dashboard. We can consider adding flags or subcommands to filter or customize the view.

# Libraries:

We'll likely use the official Docker SDK for Go to interact with the Docker API and retrieve the necessary information.

# User Interface:

The user will run a command like `ourtool dashboard` to view the dashboard. We can think about how to present the information in a clear and concise manner.

# Implementation, Testing, and Documentation:

We'll need to write the code to gather and display the information, write tests to ensure everything is working correctly, and document how to use the tool.
